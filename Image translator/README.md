# Image translator

Image translation refers to a technology where we can translate the text on images.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

Our Aim  is to To read text written in English from an Image and translating it into Kannada language.

### Requirements

MATLAB

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `IMAGE TRANSLATOR/` (that contains this README) and run one of the [image_translator.m](https://github.com/Apekshagaonkar/COMPUTER-VISION/blob/master/Image%20translator/image_translator.m) file

### Steps :
1. Preprocessing the image
2. Horizontal segmentation
3. Vertical segmentation
4. Template Matching
5. Translation

## CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS :
- This code works for fonts which is similar to the given template.
- It can be further enhanced by using neural network instead of correlation where the handwritten dataset is provided and training, testing is performed on that dataset.
- This can also be implemented using OCR inbuilt function of matlab.
